                Andrew Tellitocci is a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER turned web developer. He currently works at <a href="https://valeofinancial.com" target="_blank">Valeo Financial Advisors</a>, solving tech problems to help their advisors do more, faster.
                He graduated Purdue University in 2016 with a Bachelors of Finance. While Finance is a rewarding industry in itself, Andrew found himself drawn back to technology in early 2020
                when COVID-19 took the world by storm. Stuck at home and in search of new, non-public hobbies, he began to explore computer programming through the Unity game engine. Andrew created <i>many</i> unfinished prototypes but, in doing so, re-kindled his love for technology.
                In early 2021, he approached Valeo to lead technology initiatives across the firm and enrolled in Butler University's Coding Boot Camp. Today, he is still working through the Boot Camp, but upon graduation has plans to continue enriching
                the lives of his fellow advisors (and their clients) through continued improvements to Valeo's tech stack.
