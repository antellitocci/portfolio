## What's Here

* Portfolio landing page for projects I've worked on, or am working on.
* Addition of 404-esque page to tell user I've not finished a project listed.
* Separate style sheets for index.html and oops.html pages.
* Use of Media Queries to resize pages according to viewport size.
* Use of advanced CSS to create interesting page styles.

## Future Plans

* Continue to add to project list.
* Refactor media query to replace contact links with icons as screen size shrinks.

## Credits

The css for borders on only the four corners of an element was created using a solution by [Ashfaq Ahmed](https://codepad.co/aishfak).
> The solution is available at [CodePad](https://codepad.co/snippet/only-corner-border-for-an-element). Some minor edits were made, but the majority of the effort is from this solution.
